The White House released the memorandoum of the telephone conversation between President Trump and the Ukrainian President Zelensky. Some passages include:

> Zelensky: "...We. are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the UnitedÂ· States for defense purposes."
> Trump: "I would like you to do us a favor though..."

> Trump: "Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great."

> Trump: "The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me."

> Trump: "I will. have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it."
